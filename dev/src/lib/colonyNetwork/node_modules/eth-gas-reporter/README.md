### Install
```javascript
// Requires mocha
npm install -g mocha

// Truffle installed globally
npm install -g eth-gas-reporter

// Truffle installed locally (ProTip: This always works.)
npm install --save-dev eth-gas-reporter
```

### Truffle config
```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    ...etc...
  },
  mocha: {
    reporter: 'eth-gas-reporter',
    reporterOptions : {
      currency: 'CHF',
      gasPrice: 21
    }
  }
};
```

### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| currency | *String* | 'EUR' | National currency to represent gas costs in. Exchange rates loaded at runtime from the `coinmarketcap` api. Available currency codes can be found [here](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/). |
| gasPrice | *Number* | (varies) | Denominated in `gwei`. Default is loaded at runtime from the `eth gas station` api |
| outputFile | *String* | stdout | File path to write report output to |
| noColors | *Boolean* | false | Suppress report color. Useful if you are printing to file b/c terminal colorization corrupts the text. |
| onlyCalledMethods | *Boolean* | false | Omit methods that are never called from report. |


### Examples
+ [gnosis/gnosis-contracts](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter/blob/master/docs/gnosis.md)
+ [windingtree/LifToken](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter/blob/master/docs/lifToken.md)

### Usage Notes
+ Method calls that throw are filtered from the stats.
+ Not currently shown in the `deployments` table:
  + Contracts that link to libraries
  + Contracts that never get instantiated within the tests (e.g: only deployed in migrations)
  + Contracts that are only ever created by other contracts within Solidity.
+ Tests run slower.

### Credits
All the ideas in this utility have been borrowed from elsewhere. Many thanks to:
+ [@maurelian](https://github.com/maurelian) - Mocha reporting gas instead of time is his idea.
+ [@cag](https://github.com/cag) - The table borrows from / is based his gas statistics work for the Gnosis contracts.
+ [Neufund](https://github.com/Neufund/ico-contracts) - Block limit size ratios for contract deployments and euro pricing are borrowed from their `ico-contracts` test suite.
